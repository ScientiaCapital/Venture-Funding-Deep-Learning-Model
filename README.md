## Technologies

Before attempting to execute any Python code in credit_risk_resampling.ipynb, it is imperative that your development environment holds the following modules:

[numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Scientific computing module

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - Data analysis and manipulation module

[pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - Object-oriented filesystem path module

[sklearn](https://sklearn.org/) - Machine learning module

[imblearn](https://pypi.org/project/imblearn/) - Imbalanced machine learning module

[warnings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) - System alerts

## Installation Guide

With your _Python 3.7+_ environment, run the following commands via CLI:

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from imblearn.metrics import classification_report_imbalanced
import warnings
```

## Usage

1.  Clone repository onto your personal machine.

2.  Open Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda Navigator and navigate to the directory in which the file credit_risk_resampling.ipynb is present. All relevant code for this repository will be executed via Jupyter Notebook and no output will be printed to the command line. Ensure that all relevant dependencies and Python modules are installed (see Technologies and Installation Guide for more details) before attempting to execute code within Jupyter Notebook; otherwise, you will receive multiple interpreter errors!

3.  With the notebook open, start at the very first cell reading "Credit Risk Classification" (a cell will be active when a rectangular border is surrounding the area in question). Run each cell in sequential order. It is vital that all cells are ran in sequential order or your notebook will generate compiler errors!.
